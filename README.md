-Pig Dice Game
This repository contains the code for a Pig Dice game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Pig Dice game is a fun and interactive dice game where two players compete to reach a specific score.

-Gameplay Rules
The game starts with Player 1.
Each player takes turns rolling a dice and accumulating their scores.
Players can choose to roll the dice multiple times to increase their score in the current turn.
However, if a player rolls a 1, their current score is lost, and their turn ends.
The turn is then passed to the other player.
Players have the option to "hold" their current score, which adds it to their total score.
The first player to reach or exceed a specified score (usually 100) wins the game.
If a player reaches the winning score, all players get one final turn to try and surpass the highest score.
